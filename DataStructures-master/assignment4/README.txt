Assignment 4

Source files submitted: doubleLinkedList.h, listnode.h, main.cpp, queue.h, simulation.h, simulation.cpp, student.h, student.cpp, window.h, window.cpp

Running Instructions:
Compile by typing g++ *.cpp to compile all of the source files. Type in the text file name  when prompted. We were not able to figure out how to get the make file working and thus did not submit one as it was not working. 

References:
We used the following references to aid us in our understanding of the assignment and in areas where we needed to review/learn.
